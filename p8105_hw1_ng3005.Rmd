## Problem 1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

To write a short description of the dataset, we should visualize the first few rows

```{r}
head(early_january_weather)
```

This dataset contains 15 variables: 'origin', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'temp', 'dewp', 'humid', 'wind_dir', 'wind_speed', 'wind_gust', 'precip', 'pressure', 'visib', and 'time_hour'

```{r}
nrow(early_january_weather)
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

Using `nrow` and `ncol`, there are 358 rows and 15 columns in the dataset.

```{r}
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

Using the `mean()` function, the mean temperature in the dataset is 39.58212.




```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
